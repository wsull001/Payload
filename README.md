Wyatt Sullivan's thing

Payload
========
This folder contains all code for the UAV payload, the base station code for controling the payload, and testing data sets.

Payload functionalites:
========================
-ADLC: Will allow the UAS to automatically detect, characterize, and localize ground targets
without any human intervention. 

-IMAGE PASS THROUGH: will allow for images to be passed directly from the camera to the ground station without any object
detection algorithms being run on it. This will allow for completion of the emergent and off axis target identification.

-SRIC: will allow for the uav to connect to a remote intelligence center and retreive data that is on the server.

Folders:
=========
All folders should contain the following information for future teams
  
  -Code for subsystem
  
  -fSubsystem test procedures
  
  -Test results
  
  -Test analysis
